\subsection{Results storage}

During storage, the output file is opened for writing in binary mode.  First,
the general parameters (particles per meter and number of particles) are
written. Then, all the particles are written to the file. Note that for each
particle only vectors $\vec{p}$, $\overrightarrow{hv}$, $\vec{v}$ are written
to the file.  The order in which particles shall be written is ascending order
of identifiers. That is, the same order in which the where read.

\textbad{IMPORTANT}: Although all internal computations shall be executed
using double precision, final results shall be stored in single precision.
