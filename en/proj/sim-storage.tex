\subsection{Results storage}

During storage, the output file is opened for writing in binary mode.
The general parameters (particles per meter and number of particles) are
written. 

Then all the particles are written to the file. Note that for each particle only
vectors $\vec{p}$, $\vec{hv}$, $\vec{v}$ ar written to the file. The order in
which particles shall be written is ascending order of identifiers.

\textbad{IMPORTANT}: Although all internal computations shall be executed
using double precision, final results shall be stored in single precision.
