\subsection{Simulation processing}

The simulation processing stage performs computations on all particles in the
simulation for every time step. Consequently, this stage is repeated as many
times as time steps are specified.

For every time step the following sub-stages are executed:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Reposition each particle in the grid
\item Compute forces on each particle.
\item Process collisions.
\item Move particles.
\item Process boundaries.

\end{enumerate}
