\subsubsection{Repositioning particles}

During this stage coordinates for every particle are checked to make sure that
they are in the right block of the simulation grid. If a particle is not in the
right block, it is moved to the corresponding block.

Note that a the position of a particle may have changed. Consequently, it
may be necessary to update the block in which the particle is stored.
