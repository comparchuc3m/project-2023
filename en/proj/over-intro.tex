\subsection{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to develop an application that performs a fluid
simulation during a number of time steps.

The application takes the following comand line parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Iterations}: Number of iterations or time steps to be computed.
\item \textbf{Input}: Data file with the description of the initial state of the
fluid.
\item \textbf{Output}: Output file with the description of the final state of
the fluid.
\end{itemize}

Different versions of the application will be developed. The following variation
points shall be considered:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Precision}: While input and output files will always use
single-precision floating point, internal compuations may use either single or
double precision.

\item \textbf{Structure}: Data structures may use either a \emph{structure of
arrays} or an \emph{array of structures} approach.

\end{itemize}

Consequently 4 versions of the application may be used:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textmark{soaf}: Structures of arrays and single precision (\cppkey{float}).
\item \textmark{soad}: Structures of arrays and double precision (\cppkey{double}).
\item \textmark{aosf}: Arrays of structures and single precision (\cppkey{float}).
\item \textmark{aosd}: Arrays of structures and double precision (\cppkey{double}).
\end{enumerate}
