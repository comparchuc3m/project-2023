\subsection{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to develop an application that performs a fluid
simulation during a number of time steps.

The application takes the following command line parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Iterations}: Number of iterations or time steps to be computed.
\item \textbf{Input}: Data file with the description of the initial state of the
fluid.
\item \textbf{Output}: Output file with the description of the final state of
the fluid.
\end{itemize}

Two versions of the application shall be developed to evaluate the impact of the
selected data structure: structures of arrays (\textmark{SOA}) and array of
structures (\textmark{AOS}).

\textbad{IMPORTANT}: Although input and output files contain information using
single precision floating point numbers, all internal computations shall use
double precision floating point numbers.
